# React Support

We focus on E2E testing but in the latest versions of Cypress react component testing is now also supported. You will find guidance on that in [the Cypress React Quickstart](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/quickstart).

This section focuses on using other/additional React Cypress libraries to improve your testing React-based applications.
