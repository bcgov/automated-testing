> **TLDR:** Test Automation involves using software to automate repetitive and complex testing tasks, which is crucial for continuous delivery and testing. Test Automation Development requires coding skills, test tool knowledge, and adherence to principles such as single responsibility, separation of concerns, and clean code.

**Test Automation** is the use of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) and [continuous testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing).

Test Automation(TA) Development is a software development activity, requiring:
* Coding Skills
* Standards, framework
* Test Tool Knowledge
* IDE (VS Code)
* Code/Version Management (specifically Git/GitHub)
* Maintenance/Updates of test code and environments
* Database Skills
* CI/CD Experience for integration into pipelines


Testing Code that is produced does need to adhere to the following principles:
* **Single Responsibility** – a module should only provide one specific piece of functionality. It has a particular purpose and doesn't try to be many things to many entities. Helps to aid in maintainability and modularity. 
* **Separation of Concerns** – the system and its modules have defined boundaries of responsibility; there isn't an overlap of functionality. Helps to aid in maintainability and modularity. 
* **Refactoring of Code** – go back and look at the existing code to see if it can be cleaned up and optimized. Helps to aid in maintainability and robustness of code. 
* **Clean Code** – this follows along with [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), don't make the code too complex in its logic. Make sure code is readable and understandable, put in comments to explain what is going on and why. Helps to aid in maintainability. 
* **Documentation** - Code should be documented: purpose, how it works, explain design/coding decisions, areas of improvement
* **Traceability** - Automated tests should map to user stories or test cases
* **Value Add** - is worth to automate?
