# UI Test Automation

The definition of UI test automation shouldn’t be surprising. It merely means UI testing performed with the help of a test automation tool.

UI testing, in turn, can be defined as “the process of verifying that an app’s UI not only behaves as intended but also empowers users to make the most out of it.” 

Through UI testing, we can, among other things:

* verify that the app’s UI isn’t jarring or unintuitive;
* check whether input from the users is handled correctly, including if there is validation against invalid input;
* ensure that there are no spelling mistakes, capitalization inconsistencies, or even debugging messages that made it to production somehow;
* check against readability/legibility problems, including font size and colors.
