# Surveys and Results

In 2022 we ran a survey about test automation in order to align our efforts when creating test automation guidance with the needs, wishes and daily realities of our community.
A summarization of the results can be found [here](https://github.com/bcgov/automated-testing/blob/Updates-and-documentation/survey/Test%20Automation%20Survey.pdf).
